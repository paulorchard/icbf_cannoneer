# Restore Point — 2025-11-18

This file is a saved "restore point" note for the workspace at the time of creation.
Use it to create a quick backup before making further edits.

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-18T07:55:00 (local)

**Purpose:** capture current project state and provide quick commands to (A) create a VCS commit, or (B) create a zip archive of the important files.

Recommended steps (pick one):

- Option A — Create a Git restore commit
  - If this project is tracked by git, a fast and simple restore point is a local commit:

    ```powershell
    git add -A
    git commit -m "Restore point: 2025-11-18 — before next changes"
    ```

  - To create a branch instead (safer):

    ```powershell
    git checkout -b restore/2025-11-18
    git add -A
    git commit -m "Restore point: 2025-11-18"
    ```

- Option B — Create a ZIP archive (PowerShell)
  - Archive only source + build files (recommended to skip large caches like `run`, `.gradle`, and `build`):

    ```powershell
    Compress-Archive -Path \\@('src','build.gradle','settings.gradle','gradle','gradlew*','gradle.properties','README.md') -DestinationPath .\restore-point-20251118.zip -Force
    ```

  - To archive the entire workspace but exclude some dirs, use this pattern (PowerShell 7+):

    ```powershell
    $excludes = 'run','build','.gradle','.git' 
    $files = Get-ChildItem -Path . -Recurse -File | Where-Object { $excludes -notcontains ($_.DirectoryName.Split([io.path]::DirectorySeparatorChar) | Select-Object -Last 1) }
    Compress-Archive -Path ($files | ForEach-Object { $_.FullName }) -DestinationPath .\restore-point-full-20251118.zip -Force
    ```

- Option C — Quick copy (Windows Explorer)
  - Copy the `IslandCraft` folder to a separate location (external drive or different folder) for a manual restore.

Quick verification checklist

- [ ] Project compiles: `.\\gradlew build --no-daemon --no-parallel`
- [ ] Dev-run executed (optional): `.\\gradlew --no-daemon runClient`
- [ ] Created git commit or zip archive as above
- [ ] Note any uncommitted local changes (stashes, local settings)

Notes & context

- Created during active debugging of `ClientEvents.java` (telemetry + tracing changes). If you want I can also create the zip automatically now, or make a git commit for you (I won't run `git` without your confirmation).

- If you'd like an automated restore script added to the repo (e.g., `scripts/create_restore_point.ps1`), tell me what to include (zip-only, full, or selective), and I will add it.
